This is an HTML port of a game I made as part of the first Reddit Game Jam back in 2010.

The original game was built in XNA, but this version is built with just Canvas and JavaScript with no additional libraries.

As it's my first large JavaScript project, I expect I've done a lot of things poorly.

Feel free to [give it a try!](http://ponderousmad.com/scrace/game.html)
