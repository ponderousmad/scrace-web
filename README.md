# scrace

A simple racing game put together in 48 hours as part of the May 2010 Reddit Game Jam.

Graphics created using Inkscape and Gimp.

Audio created using Audacity.

Source requires XNA 3.1 to compile.

As of now there are 5 tracks (number keys 1-5).

Track editing is very rough, so is only visible in a debug build at the moment. If there is interest I might get around to exposing it.
